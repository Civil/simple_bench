# simple_bench
Simplistic benchmark scripts for Cisco T-Rex

external_libs and trex are from cisco trex v3.06

As trex's python client uses scapy and it is distributed under GPL, same applies for the current exporter

That is proof of concept set of scripts to run a NIC benchmark for T-Rex. It simulates simple UDP. Heavily based on [Pim van Pelt's FOSDEM talk](https://archive.fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-1919-vpp-100mpps-of-mpls-on-a-linux-pc/).

Code quality is also "PoC" level.
